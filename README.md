# End-to-End Deployment of Machine Learning Models on Google Cloud Platform: From Development to Production with Flask, Docker, and Kubernetes.

### An Easy-to-Follow Guide to Train and Deploy a Stroke Prediction Machine Learning Model on Google Kubernetes Engine.

In this repo we explore how we can build a comprehensive machine learning model to predict loan approvals and deploy the model using GCP (Google Cloud Platform), Docker, Kubernetes and Flask. In order to correctly identify people who have a high chance of having their loans approved, this model will be trained on applicant's financial historical data. The model can be used to help financial institutions to evaluate loan candidates and decide which loans to approve or reject.
