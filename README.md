# End-to-End Deployment of Machine Learning Models on Google Cloud Platform: From Development to Production with Flask, Docker, and Kubernetes.

### An Easy-to-Follow Guide to Train and Deploy a Loan Approval Prediction Machine Learning Model on GCP, Docker and Kubernetes.

In this repo we explore how we can build a comprehensive machine learning model to predict loan approvals and deploy the model using GCP (Google Cloud Platform), Docker, Kubernetes and Flask. In order to correctly identify people who have a high chance of having their loans approved, this model will be trained on applicant's financial historical data. The model can be used to help financial institutions to evaluate loan candidates and decide which loans to approve or reject. 

## Steps to deplot the model on GCP 

#### Prerequisites
- Google Cloud Platform account
  Create a google cloud account. Google cloud offers a $300 credit that you can use to access all GCP features for 3 months. Install the Google could SDK from [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).
- Docker: Install from [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
- GitHub repository with your project
